# Coding Challenges  

## Matrix problem1  

This program was written for a challenge presented on ![quera.org](https://quera.org/). I didn't know what to name this problem, so I just named it matrix problem 1. Basically, as input, it gets rows and columns of a matrix and the matrix itself. As result, the program will return the number of cells that have certain traits:
- their value is smaller than the value in their upper and lower cells  
and 
- their value is larger than the value at their left and right side
**The test cases for this program are provided in README.txt which is provided in the code's folder.**
## Pascal's triangle  

This program creates the **pascal's triangle of the binomial coefficients** that arises in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.
input:
the number of rows (n<12), the condition must be respected.
output:
pascal's triangle till the nth row
**The test cases for this program are provided in README.txt which is provided in the code's folder.**
## Table manipulation  

This program was written for a challenge presented on ![quera.org](https://quera.org/). As input, number of rows and columns + **n by n table** + the number of instructions + the instructions are given.  
The result is a table that is changed in accordance with the instructions.
The given table has the following qualities and is inputted as follows:
**Qualities:**
- each cell is either black or white
**Input Representation:**
WWB
BWB
WWW
**W -> white   and    B -> black**
The given instructions are:
- **"H"** -> mirroring the table with respect to the middle horizontal line
- **"90"** -> rotating the table clockwise for 90 degree
- **"V"** -> mirroring the table with respect to the middle vertical line

**The test cases for this program are provided in README.txt which is provided in the code's folder.**
